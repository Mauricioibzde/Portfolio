# How I Built This Portfolio

This portfolio was developed to showcase my projects and services in a clean and professional way. The main steps I followed were:

1. **Planning the structure:** I defined the sections I wanted to highlight — About Me, My Services, and My Projects.
2. **Design & Layout:** I created a simple and responsive layout using HTML5 and CSS3, focusing on readability and modern design principles.
3. **Interactivity:** I added small JavaScript features to improve navigation and user experience.
4. **Organization:** Assets such as images and icons were separated into folders to keep the project clean and scalable.
5. **Deployment:** The portfolio was published using GitHub Pages, making it easy to share and update.
